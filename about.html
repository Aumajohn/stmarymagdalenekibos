					<h3 class="mb-4">St Mary Magdalene Oasis of Peace Children's Home and school</h3>
					
               <p>     The land is 0.5 hectare. This piece of land originally belonged to the Mzee Nicholas Ondanga 
  and not profiting much from it due to thieves who would come in the night and harvest everything that was planted,
  he resolved to sell it to a buyer who after about two years resold it to mkamba man Mr. Tumbo who was an auctoineer
  in Kisumu Town. Mr. Tumbo who was a very able framer. He planted oranges, bananas, mangoes and many other things that could grow.
  He fenced the land all around wih three meters iron sheet that nobody was ale to see what was in the fenced land.
  It was both his residence and farm for ten years. He sold mangoes and other fruits in the town.<br>
  <br>The election of 2007-2008 with its ethnic violence due to outcome of the election result forced Mr. Tumbo to leave immediately in early 2008. He Knocked his house down , 
  many of his tress and packed them in tankers that ferried them to Athi River area where his father alloted 
  him a piece of land. He left the land in the care of a neighbour waiting for a buyer.
  <br><br>
   In October 2008 Sr. Fidelis called him and asked him how much he wanted for it, he told Sr. Fidelis that he wanted Kshs 1.5 millon
   but after negotiating with him he accepted to be given one million. Two days later after the money agreed had been paid,
   Sr. Mary Beatrice then the Regional Superior of Eldoret Region discussed the plan the congregation had for the land with 
   Fr. George Grima from Malta who was in Kenya to check on projects his organization sponsors.
   He told Sr. Beatrice that he was willing to assist the project that could be assisted. With some aid from Missionszentralle 
   the congregation was able to put up two classrooms and toilets to start. Two years later Fr. George Grima group put up to dormitories, Kitchen and Dining Hall
   for the orphans. The work strated and more was  sent to put up the convent.
   <br><h4 style="text-align: center;"><u>FROM 2013 ONWARDS</u></h4><br>
    Sr. Maurice Michael was sent to St. Mary Magdalene Oasis of Peace in the year 2013 January to jam start the project of the orphanage and in May 2013, Sr. Teresa
	Anne was then sent to join herso that they could be two to keep company. Being that the convent was not yet in place, they could then not manage to open the place. 
	They found when the school had been started and it had baby class and middle class.<br><br>
	As they waited to begin children's home Sr. Maurice Michael then out sport the need of the older person of the area and then i was moved to begin a group for them,
	they loved the idea and sr Maurice then argued them to register the group in case of any assistant. This our older persons acted as the grandparents of our orphans
	and they still feature in the idea in the mind of the orphans. Later on we also thought of a middle group age to stand in a mothers and
	fathers of the orphans who have missed the father figure, so they are the mentor of the children.<br><br>
	St. Mary Magdalene Oassis of Peace children's home and St. Raphael  convent were officially opened on 
	the 22nd January 2015 by His Grace Emeritus Arch Bishop Rt Rev Zaccheaus Okoth
	accompanied by Rev. Fr. George Grima the sponsor, Rev Fr. Tom Nyamanga by then the parish priest of Chiga Parish, Rev Fr. John Mac'Opiyo the assistant parish priest,
	Rev Sr Margaret Aringo the Superior General, Rev. Sr. Margaret Lydia the regional superior of 
	Eldoret region and her councillors, joined in by sisters from different communities.
	This after the children had reported on the 20th January 2015.<br><br>
	Prior to the opening of the children's Home, there was ameeting with the sponsor Rev. Fr. George Grima, 
	Sr. Margaret Lydia the regional superior of Eldoret and Sr. Maurice.
	This were remarks of Fr. Grima the sponsor; "Mine and you is finished, believe in God's providence " And for sure that marked the last of
	Rev. Fr. george Grima's trip and support to St. Mary Magdalene Oasis of Peace.<br><br>
   Rev. Sr. Margaret Lydia picked up the challenge and supported the home passionately as she could 
   until we managed through applications and networking
   to get friends who accepted to put up with the two sisters and support them little by little. 
   The two sisters sincerely believed in God's providence and God has been opening ways
through the confident the friends and sponsors developed in them. They have drilled borehole, 
installed and bought generator,managed to make wall drops, shoes racks and ceiling boards in children's 
dormitory, made terrazzo flooor for both dormitories, bought vehicle, bought tossed mattresses,
 blankets, an bed sheets for the children, bought both dining and chaoel chairs at the convent. <br><br> 

  
  These same friends have supported the two sisters to clear the land balance. 
  Family of Sue Mita and Eustace Mita who works in collaboration with Britany's Hope have also helped them
  to fence the entire home and always make follow up visit to children. The sisters have also been supported by World Mercy Fund, Missionszentralle with Lunch programme and tanks for water harvesting.<br><br>
  
  Through God's providence,they managed to get joining hearts friends who accepted to build eight classrooms for children, bought lockers, chairs and teachers tables.
  Plastic chairs for pre-primary. They have also been supported so much by other groups like Agricultural Society of Kenya through the effort of Sr. Cyprine Adek,Catechist Fredrick Otoro,
  and Mr.Odima Peter.The people have been consitent in supporting them with food every show harvesting programme and water tanks for water harvesting.
